# Sports Center Booking Management System
Access the web app at [https://scbms.herokuapp.com](https://scbms.herokuapp.com)

## Reduced Functionality Notice
The auto removal of "unpaid" bookings is not turned on on this system as it requires a paid plan to do so. When hosted on a server, by default, the operation is caried out every single minute, locally, using the `php artisan schedule:run` command.
